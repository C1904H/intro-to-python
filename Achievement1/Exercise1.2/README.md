# Exercise 2: Data Types in Python

## Tasks
- Use data types and methods to execute Python commands that store recipes containing their
own internal data
- Enter a number of these recipes into another linear data structure

## Output
- Data structures created (recipe_1, recipe_2, recipe_3, recipe_4, recipe_5)
- Created data structures added to outer structure (all_recipes)
- Screenshots of recipe_1 and attributes (name, cooking time,  ingredients), addition of recipe_1 to all_recipes, recipes_2 through to recipes_5 and their attributes, and ingredients of each recipe as five different lists.

### Step 1: 
I chose to use dictionairies to create the recipies data structures.   These structures use a mixture of strings, integers and lists and with dictionairies you can use a mix of data types. The key:value pairs make updating and finding data quick and easy.

### Step3:
I chose lists as the structure for all_recipes.  Lists are mutable and sequential in nature, so multiple recipes can be stored and modified as required.
