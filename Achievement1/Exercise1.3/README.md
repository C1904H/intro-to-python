# Exercise 1.3: Operators & Functions in Python

## Tasks
- Implement conditional statements in Python to determine program flow
- Use loops to reduce time and effort in Python programming
- Write functions to organize Python code

## Output
### Exercise_1.3.py
- Defined function `take_recipe`, which takes input from the user (variables: `name` (str), `cooking_time` (int), `ingredients` (list) and `recipe`(dictionary) which stores the variables)
- Ask user how many recipes they would like to enter (variable `n`)
- `For` loop to add ingredients to `ingredients_list` and during each loop adds each ingredient to the list and appends recipe into recipe_list
- `For` loop iterates over recipes_list and uses control flow to determine recipes's difficulty, then prints recipe info to console
