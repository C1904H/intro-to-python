# Task 2.7

## 1 - Implement Search for Recipes
For my app I'd like users to be able to search for specific recipes by the following criteria:
- Recipe name
- Specific ingredient
- Difficulty level (drop down box for the different levels) 

To increase user choice and narrow down recipes even more users can choose if they want to search by one or more of the criteria.  If a user is searching by recipe name or ingredient, a user can enter a partial search term and this will result in displaying the appropriate recipe or ingredient. 

## 3 - Data Visualization
For my app I've employed the following visualization methods:
- **Bar Chart**  
This bar chart will represent the cooking time per recipe, with the x-axis for recipe name and y-axis for cooking time.  
- **Pie Chart**  
The pie chart will display the proportion of recipes under the different difficulty levels (ie Easy, Medium, Intermediate, Hard). Each level will be represented by a different color wedge. A legend will also be displayed on the chart.
- **Line Chart**  
The line chart will show the user the number of ingredients in each recipe, with recipe name for x-axis and number of ingredients for y-axis.  

All 3 charts will be pre-determined (ie no user input) and will update as recipes are created, edited or deleted.
