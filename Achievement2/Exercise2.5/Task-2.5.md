# Model updates
My models from exercise 2.3 will remain the same, apart from addition of recipe image to the recipe app.  

# Frontend inspiration
1. BBC Good Food App  
One of my favourite recipe apps is the BBC Good Food app. I find the app has a clear and attractive layout, minimal ads and is easy to navigate.  Each recipe gives a good overview of cooking time and effort, which equates nicely to difficulty in my recipe app. I also like that users can rate and comment on the recipes.  

2. Deliciously Ella App  
Another recipe app that has inspired me is the Deliciously Ella App. I find the colors very striking, and pleasing to the eye. The pictures of the recipes are of high quality and the recipe list page isn't too busy which can detract from the recipes themselves.  I also like that it combines recipe with other health and wellness inspiration, which can give me further food for thought in developing my app in the future (ie addition of components such as wellness inspiration and mindful living).
