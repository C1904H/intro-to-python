# Exercise 2.1: Getting Started With Django

## Reflection Questions

**1. Suppose you’re a web developer in a company and need to decide if you’ll use vanilla (plain) Python for a project, or a framework like Django instead. What are the advantages and drawbacks of each?**

Django’s MVT (Model View Template) architecture  has the advantage of fast developing and processing, allowing network transmission and content delivery at high speed.
Other advantages include:
Django is implemented in Python, offering support in the backend without compromising features in the frontend
It follows DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles, keeping code non-repetitive, non-redundant and efficient
Support for Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Content Management, especially useful for content streaming where large sites handle large amounts of data
Due to it’s loosely coupled architecture, it is very easy to add new hardware and components, and so scalability is no issue
It is built with security in mind, allowing secure-by-design implementation with built-in automated encryption
Django is open source and has a large community of contributors, therefore easy to get support if required.

It’s disadvantages include:
The Django Way. Django’s firm structure means certain steps have to be taken in an exact manner. This may be challenging for developers  and means some control over the internals of a system can be lost. However, this may be a benefit for some developers!
Smaller projects. Django comes with a lot of built in essentials and so is less suitable if projects don’t require features such as database access or file management.  As it has a lot of prewritten code it is server intensive which makes it heavy on low-bandwidth systems, this is best avoided if not required.

Vanilla Python is better suited for smaller projects with minimal functionality (eg database access not required) and where developer control of certain areas of the app is required. However, Vanilla Python development speed is a lot slower than Django, as everything needs to be built from scratch.  The developer will also need to consider security features. It may also be difficult to source support if required as don’t have the help of the Django community.

**3. In your own words, what is the most significant advantage of Model View Template (MVT) architecture over Model View Controller (MVC) architecture?**

The most significant advantage of MVT over MVC architecture is that the Template handles the rendering separately from business logic, making it easier to maintain and update the UI.

Now that you’ve had an introduction to the Django framework, write down three goals you have for yourself and your learning process during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps:
What do you want to learn about Django? 

I’d like to learn the important features of Django and how they can be utilised in the development of my app.

**3. What do you want to get out of this Achievement?**

By the end of this achievement I’d like have a comprehensive understanding of Django and be proficient is using the framework.  I’d like to be comfortable working with Django’s ORM, views and templates.

Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

I’d like to try and create my own Python app to test my understanding and develop my skills further. I will also be working on completing the Job Preparation course and starting my job hunt.
